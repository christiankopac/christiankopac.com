# Music

Music has alway been a big and important part of my life, as with [many other human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music).

Since 2014, I'm a member of the music editorial at [Radio Študent](https://www.radiostudent.si/).

In 2017 I co-founded [Imaginary Radio Stations](https://imaginaryradiostations.com/), a series of events and mixes with the aim to provide a space for music free from genre restrictions
and limitations in the context of the city of Berlin, which is nowadays filled with _mainstream_ techno and house music.

I spend some of my free time in the studio, recording and producing music under the moniker [CP-AK](https://soundcloud.com/cp-ak).

When I'm not producing music, I'm usually out in the nature either learning about Berlin's [inbetween_nature](https://www.instagram.com/inbetween_nature/)'s spaces, walking the dog, a beatiful and lovely [Lagotto Romagnolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagotto_Romagnolo) called _Tilla_ or running.

Below you can find some of the music selections I've made for the radio station as well as some of the mixes recorded on the _IRS_ events or notes on my learning in music theory.
