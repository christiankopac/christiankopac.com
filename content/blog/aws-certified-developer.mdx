## IAM

- CENTRALIZED: control of you aws account
- ACCESS: shared acces to your aws account
- PERMISSIONS: granular permissions
- IDENTITY FEDERATION: supports federated access

- MULTI-FACTOR-AUTHENTICATION
- TEMPORARY ACCESS: temporary access to your aws account
- PASSWORD POLICIES
- INTEGRATED
- COMPLIANCE

- Users: end users, think people
- Groups: collection of users under one set of permissions
- Roles: you can create roles and assign them to users,
  applications and services
- IAM Policy: a document that defines one or more permissions

<!-- IAM DEMO: MFA, Create user, groups, policies, roles... -->

### IAM Exam tips

- IAM Policy simulator

  - Test IAM permissions before you commit them to production
  - Validate that the policy works as expected
  - You can test policies attached to existing users

- IAM consists of USERS, GROUPS and ROLES
- Policy document (JSON), series of key value pairs with permissions
- IAM is universal, not regional
- The root account is created when you first register with AWS (complete admin access)
- Users have no permissions at all when created

- New users

  - Access key ID and secret access key
  - Not for console access
  - Programmatic Access

- Viewing Access Keys, possible only once, when created!
- Use MFA
- Password roration

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- Secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- Like a VM, hosted on AWS
- Designed to make web-scale cloud computing for developer
- The capacity you want when you need it
- You are in complete control of your own instances

Benefits:

- Game changer
- Pay only for what you use
- No wasted capacity
- EC2 is like a VM hosted on AWS instead of you own data center.

### EC2 Pricing Options

- On-demand
  Pay by the hour or the second depending on the instance type

  1. Flexible: Low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without long term commitment
  2. Short-term
  3. Testing the water

- Reserved
  Reserve capacity for one or three years with an up to 72% discount of the hourly charge.
  Great if you have known, fixed requirements
  Operate at a regional level

  1. Predictable usage
  2. Specific capacity requirements
  3. Pay up-front
  4. Standard Reserved Instances (RIs) up to 72% off on-demand price
  5. Convertible RIs, up to 54% off on-demand price
  6. Schedule RIs: launch within the time window you define

- Spot
  Purchase unused capacity at a discount up to 90%.

  When:

  1. Users with an urgent need for large ammounts of computing capacity
  2. Application that have flexible start and end times
  3. Applications that are only feasibal eat very low compute prices

- Dedicated
  A physical EC2 server
  Great if you have server-bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements.

  When:

  1. Compliance
  2. Licencisng
  3. On-Demand
  4. Reserved

### Savings plan:

- Save up to 72%
- Commit to one or three years
- Super Flexible (technologies like Lambda or Fargate)

### EC2 Instance Types

- Hardware
  When you launch an instance the typ determines the hardware of the ost computer
- Capabilites
  Each type offers different compute memory and storage capabilities
- Application requiremens
  Select an instance based on the requirements of the application you plan to run on the instance

Example:

- AWS Dashboard
- EC2
- Launch instance
- Amazon Linux 2

## EBS Volumes

[Elastic Block Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html)

Storage volumes that you can attach to your EC2 instances

EBS Volume Types:

- General Purpose SSD **gp2**: 3 IOPS per GB, great for applications not latency sensitive
- Provisioned IOPS SSD: **io1**, **io2**
  - io1: 50 IOPS per GB
  - io2: 500 IOPS per GB
  - I/O intensive apps
- Throughput Optimized HDD: **st1**
  - Low cost HDD volume
- Cold HDD **sc1**
  - Lowest cost option
  - Good for applications that need the lowest cost and performance is not a factor
  - Good choice for data requireign fewer scans per day

| IOPS                                                                               | Throughut                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Measures the number of read and write operations per second.                       | Measures the number of bits read or written per second                |
| Important metric for quick transactions, low latency apps, transactional workloads | Important metric for larga datasets, large I/O sizes, complex queries |
| The ability to actin reads and writes very quickly                                 | The ability to deal with large datasets                               |
| Choose provisions IPS SSD (io2 or io2)                                             | Choose Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)                                 |

### EBS Exam Tips

- Highly availably and scalable storage volumes you can attach to your EC2 instancen
- gp2: suitable for boot disks and general application (up to 15.0000 IOPS per volume)
- io1: suitable for OLTP and latency sensitive application, 50 IOPS/GB, up to 64.0000 IOPS per volume, high performance and most expensive
- io1: suitable for OLTP and latency sensitive application, 500 IOPS/GB, up to 64.0000 IOPS per volume, high performance and most expensive
- st1: suitable for big data, data warehoises, ETL. 500MBs per volume
- sc1 (cold HDD): max of 250MBs per volume, less frequently accessed data

## Elastic Load Balancer

Distributes network traffic across a group of servers.

- Application load balancer (HTTP and TCP) - Layer 7
- Network load balancer (TCP and high performance) - Layer 4
- Classic load balancer (HTTP, HTTPS and TCP) - ???
  Legacy, HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, Supports Layer 7 and Layer 4

- Layer 7: Application
  What the end user sees, HTTP, web browsers.
- Layer 6: Presentation
  Data is in usable format. Encryption, SSH
- Layer 5: Session
  Maintains connections and sessions
- Layer 4: Transport
  Transmits data using TCP and UDP
- Layer 3: Network
  Logically routes packets based on IP address
- Layer 2: Data Link
  Physically transmits data based on MAC addresses
- Layer 1: Physical
  Transmits bits and bytes over physical devices

### ELB Exam Tips

- `XForwardedFor` header is used to know the client IP address
- `504 Error` the application is not responding within the timeout period
